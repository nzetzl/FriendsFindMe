# FriendsFindMe

FriendsFindMe notifies users when another user passes them on the street using their GPS locations. An arrow appears on the users' watches' screens, pointing them in the direction of their friend.

I was in charge of developing the android part of this application. This included sending data to the server, receiving a response back, and then sending that data to the pebble smartwatch.
